# SEIR_Project2_ZF

## Project Concept

  Intended to be a replacement to a home page for google users. Was also intened to be a new tab replacement which I found out a long the way is only available through plug ins so it will need further development for that.

  ## Message in a Bottle

  The idea is people can send out messages in a "bottle" to the world and some random person who opens their browser will get that message. They can either remove the message, edit it and send it back out or leave it as is and send it back out.

  ## Early development

  The first problems were setting up all the paths. I had copied some code from a previous assignment to get started which actually helped me get started really fast... but then I started running into issues. I spent 2 days trying to debug why my new and edit routes were not posting to the Database.

  ## Lesson learned

  At the end of the second day I found the issue. Some of the code I had pasted for my schema still had number as the type when it needed to be text. This was causing my route to fail for edit and new.

  Told a friend and he summarized the experience like this "welcome to programming, where a single character can make you question every life choice and decision that led you to this moment"

  ## Proud moments

  Truthfully speaking the page is very simple and not much complexity but I enjoyed the concept so much that I wanted to go with it. Long term I would like to add more to it. Images / themes / icons ect.
  So much time was wasted trying to get the routes right that I did not get to any of this with enough time to know I could finish.
